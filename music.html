        I have had always loved good Music blended into a scene. The synchronization
        of the audio and visual itself elevates the scene and touches the viewer unconscio-
        usly. There was once a time when movies didn't include any audio, only music!
        Before talkies, or movies where audiences heard the characters' spoken words, 
        there were silent films. The audience followed the action on screen as it was
        accompanied by music and periodic subtitles that described the action.<br><br>

        In 1927, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018037/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2" target="_blank">The Jazz Singer</a> transformed the silent film industry by becoming the
        first movie to match actors' moving lips to their voices. In 1935, the 
        <a href="https://www.oscars.org/" target="_blank">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> began awarding Oscars for music
        in film, and with good reason!
