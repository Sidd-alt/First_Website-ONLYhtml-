        <strong>CINEMA</strong>is regarded as art form which is layered. Any MOVIE can't be really understood just on the first watch.
        Cinema is both art and science. If we break down a bit, we can find that cinema is actually a combination of 
        sound and visual. We as a humans, in real life don't believe in something that we haven't heard with our ears 
        or seen with our own eyes. As a result, whatever we view in real life becomes a part of our memory. Cinema has
        the same power to make itself stay in the memory of the viewer. As a result it is very important to view good 
        cinema.
        Cinema that can make us think about our awareness of being alive as a human. According to IMDB,
        since 1900 there's been an average of 2,577 films produced each year around the world.In modern world, there are number of sources 
        available for viewing Movies. With high speed internet,
        anyone from anywhere in the world can access the films right on his mobile phones, laptops, tablets. With the growing
        industry of online streaming like Netflix and Amazon, the experience is not as that of watching a film in a film 
		theatre with friends and families. Just my thoughts!
        It may be feasible for someone to view this beautiful medium on Internet. But the point here is the to view, to watch,
        to get impacted by the power of Cinema... </font></p>
