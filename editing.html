            Film editing is both a creative and a technical part of the post-production 
            process of filmmaking. The term is derived from the traditional process of 
            working with film which increasingly involves the use of digital technology.
            The film editor works with the raw footage, selecting shots and combining them 
            into sequences which create a finished motion picture. Film editing is described 
            as an art or skill, the only art that is unique to cinema, separating filmmaking 
            from other art forms that preceded it, although there are close parallels to 
            the editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing. Film 
            editing is often referred to as the "invisible art" because when it is
            well-practiced, the viewer can become so engaged that he or she is not aware of
            the editor's work. On its most fundamental level, film editing is the art, technique
             and practice of assembling shots into a coherent sequence. The job of an editor
            is not simply to mechanically put pieces of a film together, cut off film slates
            or edit dialogue scenes. A film editor must creatively work with the layers of
            images, story, dialogue, music, pacing, as well as the actors' performances to
            effectively "re-imagine" and even rewrite the film to craft a cohesive whole.
            Editors usually play a dynamic role in the making of a film. Sometimes,
            auteurist film directors edit their own films, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa" target="_blank">Akira Kurosawa</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahram_Beyzai" target="_blank">Bahram
