        The film directorâ€™s primary task is to interpret the screenplay and translate
        it visually. He is the creative mind that chooses the aesthetical and technical
        specifications to be implemented in his vision. To succeed in this mission, he
        is involved from the early stages of pre-production all the way to the final 
        phase of post. According to me a film director is like a orchestra player who
        gives the entities of cinema, be it cinematography, acting, editing etc, a kind 
        of instructions on what and how to do. He is a captain of the ship. It's upto
        the imagination power of a director to bring his ambition story on screen.
