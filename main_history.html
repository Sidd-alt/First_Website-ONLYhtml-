	<p>No one person invented cinema. However, in 1891 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_(company)" target="_blank">Edison company</a> successfully demonstrated a prototype of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope#:~:text=The%20Kinetoscope%20is%20an%20early,the%20top%20of%20the%20device.">Kinetoscope</a>, 
        which enabled one person at a time to view moving pictures.

    The first public Kinetoscope demonstration took place in 1893. By 1894 the Kinetoscope was a commercial success, with public parlours
     established around the world.

    The first to present projected moving pictures to a paying audience were the Lumière brothers in December 1895 in Paris, France. 
    They used a device of their own making, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Cinematographe" target="_blank">Cinématographe</a>, which was a camera, a projector and a film printer all in one.</p>

    <p>At the start of the <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" target="_blank"></a>First World War</mark>, French and Italian cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating
    interruption to European film industries.The American industry, or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Hollywood-California" target="_blank">"Hollywood"</a>, as it was becoming known after its new geographical
    center in California, gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product 
    to most countries on earth. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average 
    of 800 feature films annually,[79] or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" target="_blank">Charlie Chaplin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton" target="_blank"> Buster Keaton</a>,
     the swashbuckling adventures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks" target="_blank">Douglas Fairbanks</a> and the romances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow" target="_blank">Clara Bow</a>, to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces
      well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical continuity editing was developed and exported – although
     its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong realist traditions in art and drama, such as Japan.</p><br><br>

     contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and 
     biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media formats.</p><br><br>
