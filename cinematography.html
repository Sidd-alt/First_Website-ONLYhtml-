        Cinematography is the art of motion-picture photography and filming either electronically
        by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
        such as film stock. Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light from objects 
        into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material 
        inside a movie camera. These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later
        processing and viewing as a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/motion-picture" target="_blank">motion picture</a>. Capturing images with an electronic image
        sensor produces an electrical charge for each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel" target="_blank">pixel</a> in the image, which is electronically
        processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display. Images captured
        with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock,
        which are chemically "developed" into a visible image. The images on the film stock are
        projected for viewing the motion picture.
