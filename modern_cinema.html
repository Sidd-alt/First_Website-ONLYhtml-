        These were the guys that gave new experience to the world of cinema. They initiated what is now called the "new era of filmmaking". 
        Their films were both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" target="_blank">Steven Speilberg</a>, who now is the richest director in the world,
        started with his 8mm film camera. Well, his filmography consist of all blockbuster films. But having said he is also known for critically 
        acclaimed films like, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Saving Private Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Schindler's List</a>. Next to his is the greatest living filmmaker and my personal favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" target="_blank">Martin 
        Scorsese</a>. He is a kind of filmmaker who from the very start, made films which were altogether realistic yet entertaining. He strongly believes 
        that Cinema has that power to make an impact on a person's thought process, which would make a person think. He and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" target="_blank">Robert 
        Di Niro</a> are the director and actor duo. They have worked together in almost nine films. Martin Scorsese is well known for films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Goodfellas</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3" target="_blank">Hugo</a>
        and the much latest film The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Irishman</a>. Next is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" target="_blank">Brian De Palma</a>, the guy who gave the idea of starting rolling credits for the very first <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Star
        Wars</a> film. His directorial films <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Mission Impossible</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">The Scarface</a>. And the comes the director who all the 70's and 80's kids are acquainted 
        with, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" target="_blank">George Lucas</a>. His films includes <a href="https://www.imdb.com/star-wars/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Star Wars franchise</a>. He made an entire two generation of humans into believing his imaginatory 
        storytelling. And the very last, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" target="_blank">Francis Ford Coppola</a>. He was the kind of director, who could tell much emotional films and that too 
        with powerful story. His is most well known for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150742/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">The Godfather Triology</a>. But the film I admire his most is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank">Apocalypse Now</a> released in 
        1979. All these five personalities are often called as "Movie Brats". They paved the way for future modern filmmakers like, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" target="_blank">James Cameron</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jonze" target="_blank">Spike Jonze</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bong_Joon-ho" target="_blank">Bong Joon Ho</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Kashyap" target="_blank">Anurag Kashyap</a>. History will remember them for their effective contribution to the world of filmmaking and to
        the world of Cinema.<br><br><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" bold>Modern filmmakers of the 90's</font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7OnBcsQNho" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
