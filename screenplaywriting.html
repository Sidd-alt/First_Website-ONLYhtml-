        A screenplay is an entirely different beast than a novel, essay, poem, or even
        short story. A screenplay demands extreme clarity and creativity in your visual 
        descriptions, which can be a challenge. The screenplay is the guide for the
        Producers, Director, Actors, Crew of exactly what will appear on screen.  It is 
        the common ground that everybody on the film will work with from start to finish
        of production.

        It tells the complete story, contains all action in the film and all dialogue for
        each character. It can also describe characters visually so filmmakers can try to
        capture their style, look or vibe.
